This is a test MonoGame project to show a problem with MonoGame on Windows 10 that doesn't occur on Windows 7.

The effect/shader should show a model of the earth with continents and a day/night shader/effect.

This project also being used to try to see if there is a way to compile a DEBUG version of MonoGame 3.6 and step into the MonoGame classes in the Visual Studio 2017 debugger.

The two MonoGame issues that use this code are at:
